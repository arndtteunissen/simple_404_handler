# Simple 404 Handling
This extension enables simple *404 Page Not Found* handling, also for multilingual sites.
It does not override but uses the TYPO3 core error handling API.

## Motivation
By default the TYPO3 core enables error handling for pages, even with including other pages, but it doesn't support multilingualism.
